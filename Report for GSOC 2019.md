### Week 2 (June 03 - June 09)

Weekly Activity

1. Weekly e-meet: The following topics were discussed:
   - Appearance and functionality of display section. After discussion we concluded to have a simpler interface, displying only the `variables` in the selector. Other global properties would be always visible.
   - Overview and usage of tests.
   - Features and functionality of Fields panel.
2. Implemented simpler interface consisting of Display and description section ([PR #2](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/2)). For more details please refer [Issue #14](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/14) and [Issue #15](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/14). Current status:

![Simpler Interface](assets/05_simpler_interface.png)
3. Started implementation of Basic Fields and Output Panel ([PR#3](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/3)). Current status:

![Basic Fields and Output Panel](assets/06_fields_output.png)


### Week 3 (June 10 - June 16)

Weekly Activity

1. Improved the Basic fields and output panel. Added support for plotting data coordinates with respect to variables, which earlier resulted in errors.
2. Completed implementation of Basic Fields and Output Panel ([PR #3](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/3)). The plotting function has been reimplemented using `sel` method.
3. The following topics were discussed in weekly e-meet:
   - `ignore_events` method present in `dfviz`, can be useful for some interactions in `xrviz`.
   - Demonstrated the working of interface.
   - `convert_widget` function.
   - Way to set/reset variables to coordinates.
   - Aggregation methods ([Issue #21](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/21))
   - Overview of tasks for Phase 2:
       - Style Panel ([Issue #22](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/22))
       - Projection Panel ([Issue #23](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/23))
       - Time series extraction ([Issue #24](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/24))
4. Started implementation of Aggregations in the fields panel ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4)). Current Status:
  - For single selection

![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/07_agg1.png)

  - For multiple selections
   
![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/08_agg2.png)
![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/09_agg3.png)

5. Started discussion to find out a possible solution to set and reset coordinates within the interface. For more details please refer [Issue #20](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/20).


### Week 4 (June 17 - June 23)

Weekly Activity

1. Improved the functionality implemented earlier for Aggregations in the Fields panel. Now the user can aggregate along remaining dimensions (not selected in `x` and `y` ). The option to create a `Select` widget or `Animate` is also present in case the user does not wish to apply any aggregation on the dimension. ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4))

![Aggregations](assets/10_agg_final.png)

2. Implemented functionality to set reset coords ([PR #7](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/7)). User can select and set any variable as a coordinate.

![Set Reset Coords](assets/11_set_coords.png)

3. Modified set reset coords to work with aggregations. The user can have aggregation for a variable along a dimension, even when `x` and `y` Select has `coord` as options.

![Set Reset Coords](assets/12_set_coords.png)

4. Weekly e-meet: The following topics were discussed:
  - Installation package ([PR #8588 · conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/8588))
  - Demonstration of Aggregations ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4))
  - Demonstration of Set reset Coords ([PR #7](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/7))
  - Discussed Tabular Rearrangement ([Issue #26](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/26))
  - Generalisability of the interface: In future the dashboard can be used as base by the users, or community to visualise data related to a particular domain such as Astronomy, Oceanography by adding domian specific customisations.
5. XrViz can be installed as a package by `conda install -c conda-forge xrviz`. ([conda-forge/xrviz-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/xrviz-feedstock))

## Current State of the Project

The work done during the coding period has laid down a foundation for further development of XrViz. It is well positioned to grow and thrive, embedded in the intake project. The documentation would provide a good starting point for future contributors to get acquainted with the interface. The feedback I've received so far from the community indicates that they find this as a valuable contribution.

**Merged Pull Requests**:

## Future work

I feel that we have achieved most of what we set out to do in terms of deliverables. However, the following additions will make the interface more useful:
1. Integration of Xrviz in Intake GUI.
2. A way to launch the dashboard directly from command line as done in ncview.
3. The dashboard can be customised to visualise data related to a particular domain such as Astronomy, Oceanography by adding domian specific operations and functionality.

## Learnings

Working with ESIP, Intake and HoloViz under Google Summer of Code has been an amazing and rewarding experience. It has provided me a chance for learning and self improvement. Here are some of the lessons I have learnt:

1. Creating interactive GUI with Panel and dashboarding. Well designed GUIs have the potential to simplify the workflow and save user time.
2. The importance of automated testing in software development. Pytest and Travis CI has been used in this project.
3. Creating and writing documentation. Clear and concise documentation requires careful thinking.
4. Routine code submission, discussion and review by mentors helps completing task in short time and in directed manner.
5. Became more familiar with Git, Github and open source culture and software development in general. Also learnt several python best practices. This would be helpful in contributing to other projects.
6. This project increased my interest in events and developments of earth science community.
7. The importance of effective communication in open source. This is the key to explain your ideas and get help from others on the issues being faced. Weekly e-meets helped me gain more confidence and ability to express myself better.
8. Always staying open to new ideas and suggestions is vital. It helps you to understand the viewpoint of mentors, community and any other person in general.

## Acknowledgment

I am extremely grateful to my mentors Rich Signell and Martin Durant for helping me out at various stages throughout the summer. Special thanks to Annie Burgess, ESIP Lab Director for facilitating the Summer Program. Sincere gratitude to Google for offering me this great opportunity.
